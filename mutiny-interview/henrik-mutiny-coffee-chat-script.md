## THE SCRIPT

---

### PART 1: OPENING -- SMALL TALK & RAPPORT (2-3 minutes)

[Henrik will likely keep this casual. He is Scandinavian, a founder, and a builder -- not a stiff corporate interviewer. Match his energy. Be warm but not overly performative.]

**When the call starts:**

> "Hey Henrik, great to meet you. Thanks for taking the time."

[Let him set the tone. If he asks "how's your day" or makes small talk, engage naturally. Some possible threads:]

- **If he mentions the NYC office:** "Are you enjoying being in New York? I saw Mutiny is building out the NYC presence -- that's exciting."
- **If the weather/location comes up:** Keep it brief and pivot naturally.
- **If he asks where you're based:** Answer, and if relevant, mention your proximity to/excitement about the NYC office.

[OPTIONAL -- only if it flows naturally and you have genuine connection points:]

- If you have any connection to Sweden, Scandinavia, or European design culture, this is a natural rapport builder. Henrik is Swedish and his early career was in Stockholm/Berlin.
- If you have used Readmill, Dropbox Paper, or any product he worked on, a brief authentic mention lands well. ("I was actually a Readmill user back in the day" -- but only if true.)
- If you have any personal connection to diabetes, healthcare tech, or CGM devices, Henrik founded a diabetes clinic out of personal experience. This would be a genuine connection point.

---

### PART 2: YOUR BACKGROUND & CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES (5-7 minutes)

[Henrik has been a designer, PM, founder, and exec. He will respect a crisp narrative, not a resume walkthrough. Tell a story with a thread connecting your choices.]

**Framework for your intro (fill in the blanks):**

> "So a bit about me -- I'm a product designer with [X] years of experience, most recently at [CURRENT/MOST RECENT COMPANY] where I [ONE SENTENCE ON SCOPE -- e.g., 'own the design for the core workflow product' or 'led design for the enterprise dashboard experience'].

> Before that I was at [PREVIOUS COMPANY] working on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]. The thread through my career has been [YOUR THREAD -- e.g., 'designing complex tools that make sophisticated capabilities feel simple' or 'bringing consumer-grade design quality to enterprise products' or 'figuring out how to give users control over powerful systems without overwhelming them'].

> Right now my day-to-day looks like [BRIEF -- e.g., 'I'm embedded with a PM and three engineers, owning the end-to-end experience for ___. I do everything from early discovery and prototyping through to pixel-level specs and QA.']"

[TIPS:]
- Keep this to 90 seconds max. He will ask follow-ups on what interests him.
- Emphasize any experience with: complex workflows, creative tools, AI-powered features, enterprise SaaS, or marketing/sales products.
- If you have 0-to-1 experience (built something from scratch), highlight it. Henrik is a founder who values building from nothing.
- If you have experience balancing automation with user control, flag it. That is the core design challenge of this role.

---

### PART 3: A PROJECT YOU'RE PROUD OF (3-5 minutes)

[Have one strong project ready. Pick one that maps to what this role demands.]

**Best project to pick -- one that shows ANY of these:**
1. Designing a complex workflow that you made intuitive
2. Working with AI/ML features and figuring out how to give users trust and control
3. Going from ambiguity to a shipped product (0-to-1)
4. Collaborating closely with PM and engineering to solve hard problems
5. Designing for power users / enterprise customers who need flexibility

**Framework:**

> "One project I'm really proud of is [PROJECT NAME/DESCRIPTION].

> The challenge was [WHAT MADE IT HARD -- e.g., 'users needed to configure complex rules but the existing UI required engineering support' or 'we were introducing AI-generated content and users didn't trust it'].

> My approach was [WHAT YOU DID -- e.g., 'I started by spending two weeks with customers, then developed a progressive disclosure model that let novice users get started immediately while power users could access the full complexity'].

> The outcome was [MEASURABLE RESULT IF POSSIBLE -- e.g., 'we cut setup time by 60%' or 'adoption went from 20% to 70% in the first month'].

> What I learned from it was [INSIGHT -- e.g., 'that the best AI interfaces aren't about hiding the AI, they're about making the human feel like they're collaborating with it, not being replaced by it']."

[NOTE: If Henrik asks follow-up questions, this is a great sign. Let the conversation breathe. Don't rush to the next talking point.]

---

### PART 4: WHY MUTINY SPECIFICALLY (3-4 minutes)

[This is where you show you did your homework. Be specific. Henrik is a founder and builder -- he can smell generic enthusiasm.]

**Talking points (pick 2-3, don't use all of them):**

> **On the product challenge:**
> "What really drew me to Mutiny is the design problem at the center of the product. You're building tools where AI agents do the heavy lifting -- account research, content generation, personalization -- but the human marketer still needs to feel in control, trust the output, and be able to steer it. That balance between automation and human agency is exactly the kind of design challenge I find most interesting."

> **On the stage of the company:**
> "I'm also excited about the stage Mutiny is at. You have real traction -- Uber, Qualtrics, Snowflake as customers -- but you're still building out core product surfaces like the Campaign Builder and Creative Agent. It's that sweet spot where the product-market fit is proven but the product experience is still being defined. That's where I do my best work."

> **On the agentic AI angle:**
> "The shift from a personalization tool to a full agentic GTM platform is fascinating. Designing for AI agents that research accounts, generate creative, and orchestrate campaigns -- that's a fundamentally new interaction model. I want to be part of figuring out what that looks like."

> **On the team/Henrik specifically (use carefully -- be genuine, not flattering):**
> "I also noticed that product and design report to the same leader here, which I think is really important. In my experience, the best products come from tight integration between those disciplines, and the fact that you come from a design background yourself tells me design has real influence on product direction."

> **On the values:**
> "I resonate with 'faster always wins' -- I'm someone who prefers to ship and learn rather than over-design in a vacuum. And 'work should feel like play' maps to how I think about the craft of design."

### PART 5: DESIGN APPROACH & CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION (3-5 minutes)

[Henrik will probe how you work, not just what you've made. He has been on all sides -- designer, PM, engineer, CEO. He wants to know you can operate in the messy middle.]

**If asked "How do you work with PM and Eng?":**

> "My default is to be embedded early. I don't want a brief handed to me -- I want to be in the problem space alongside the PM from the start. Typically I'll [DESCRIBE YOUR PROCESS -- e.g., 'run discovery interviews, synthesize patterns, then work in rapid low-fi explorations before we align on direction'].

> With engineering, I try to involve them before designs are 'done.' I've found that the best solutions come from engineers understanding the *why* behind a design, and from me understanding the technical constraints early enough to design around them rather than throwing things over the wall.

> I'm also comfortable working at different fidelity levels depending on what the team needs -- sometimes it's a rough sketch on a whiteboard to align on a concept, sometimes it's a polished prototype to test with users."

**If asked "How do you handle disagreements with PM or Eng?":**

> "I start with trying to understand what they're optimizing for. Usually disagreements come from different people looking at different constraints -- the PM is worried about scope, the engineer is worried about tech debt, I'm worried about user experience. Once we're looking at the same set of tradeoffs, we can usually find a solution that works. I'm not precious about my ideas -- I'm precious about the outcome for the user."

**If asked "How do you think about AI in design?":**

> "I think we're at a point where the design of AI tools is more important than the AI itself. The underlying models are getting commoditized. The differentiator is the interface -- how you give users transparency into what the AI is doing, how you let them steer and correct it, and how you build trust over time. That's a design problem, not an engineering problem. [CONNECT TO YOUR EXPERIENCE IF POSSIBLE]."

---

### PART 6: SMART QUESTIONS TO ASK HENRIK (5-7 minutes)

[Save 5-7 minutes for questions. This is where you differentiate yourself. Ask questions that show you understand the product and the role, not questions you could answer by reading the job posting.]

**Tier 1: Ask these (pick 2-3):**

1. **"You've built products from zero-to-one multiple times -- Readmill, Steady Health -- and you've also scaled products at Dropbox and Big Health. Where does Mutiny feel like it is right now on that spectrum, and what does that mean for how the design team needs to operate?"**
   [This shows you researched his background and are thinking about what the work actually requires.]

2. **"The Campaign Builder and Creative Agent are the core surfaces for this role. What's the biggest unsolved design challenge in those products right now?"**
   [This gets him talking about the real work. His answer will tell you exactly what the first 90 days would look like.]

3. **"How does the design team at Mutiny work today? Is there an established design system, or is this still being built? How much of the role is building foundations vs. shipping features?"**
   [Practical question that shows you're thinking about what you'd actually walk into.]

4. **"Mutiny's product is becoming more agentic -- AI agents that research, generate, and act on behalf of users. How are you thinking about the role of the human in that loop? Is the long-term vision more co-pilot or more autopilot?"**
   [This is a product vision question disguised as a design question. It will light Henrik up because this is exactly the kind of thing a Head of Product & Design thinks about.]

5. **"What does 'unreasonably high bar for design quality' look like at Mutiny in practice? Can you give me an example of a recent design decision where that bar was tested?"**
   [References Mutiny's own language about design quality. Shows you dug into their hiring philosophy.]

**Tier 2: If time allows or conversation flows there:**

6. "What made you decide to join Mutiny after Big Health? What was the draw?"
   [Gets him talking about himself -- people like this. Also gives you insight into what makes Mutiny special from an insider perspective.]

7. "How does the product team think about the balance between serving marketers vs. sellers? Those can be very different user personas."
   [Shows product thinking, not just design thinking.]

8. "What does success look like for this role in the first 6 months?"
   [Direct, practical, shows you're already thinking about impact.]

---

### PART 7: HANDLING COMP / TIMELINE / LOGISTICS (2-3 minutes)

[Henrik or the recruiter may bring this up. Be honest and brief. Don't negotiate in this call -- just establish alignment.]

**If asked about compensation expectations:**

> "I've seen the range posted is $180K to $230K base plus equity. That's in line with what I'm looking for. I'm more focused on finding the right role and team, but I'm happy to dive deeper into comp details as we get further along."

[If you have a specific number in mind that's within range, you can say:]
> "Based on my experience, I'd be targeting the [mid/upper] end of that range, but I'm flexible and want to understand the full picture including equity."

[If your expectations are above the range, be honest early:]
> "I want to be transparent -- my current comp is [X], so I'd want to make sure we're aligned. I'm flexible depending on the equity component and overall opportunity."

**If asked about timeline:**

> "I'm [actively looking / exploring selectively / wrapping up conversations elsewhere]. My timeline is [flexible / I'm hoping to make a decision in the next X weeks]. I'm very interested in Mutiny specifically, so I'm happy to move at whatever pace works for your process."

[If you have competing offers:]
> "I do have [a process / conversations] moving forward at another company, but Mutiny is a top choice for me. I want to be respectful of everyone's time, so I wanted to flag the timing."

**If asked about NYC / in-office:**

> "Yes, I'm [based in NYC / planning to be in NYC / happy to relocate]. I'm comfortable with being in-office -- I actually prefer it for design work, especially in a collaborative environment."

[If you have concerns about 5 days in-office, be honest but frame it positively:]
> "I'm excited about the in-person culture. I do my best collaborative work face-to-face. I'm curious about how the team uses office time -- is it structured around specific meetings or more organic?"

---

### PART 8: CLOSING (1-2 minutes)

[End strong. Be direct about your interest. Don't be coy.]

> "Henrik, this was really great. I'm genuinely excited about this role -- the product challenge, the stage of the company, and the way you're thinking about design here. I'd love to move forward and dig deeper in the next round."

[If you want to add a personal touch:]
> "I've been thinking a lot about what it means to design for AI-native products, and this feels like one of the most interesting versions of that problem. I'd love the chance to show you my work in the portfolio review."

**After the call:**
- Send a brief thank-you note within 2 hours (email or LinkedIn message, not both).
- Reference one specific thing from the conversation -- something Henrik said that stuck with you.
- Keep it to 3-4 sentences. Do not write a novel.

## THINGS TO AVOID

- **Don't say "I love your company values."** Instead, reference a specific value and connect it to how you work.
- **Don't ask questions you could answer from the website.** ("So what does Mutiny do?")
- **Don't badmouth your current employer.** Frame your move as going toward something, not away from something.
- **Don't over-rehearse.** Henrik is a builder, not an HR interviewer. He will notice if you sound scripted. Know your talking points but deliver them conversationally.
- **Don't pretend to know things you don't.** If he asks about ABM or enterprise GTM and you're not deeply familiar, say "I'm still building my understanding of the GTM space, but here's how I'd approach learning it quickly..." Intellectual honesty will resonate with him more than faking expertise.
- **Don't skip the questions section.** Having thoughtful questions is more important than having perfect answers. It shows you're evaluating them too -- which signals confidence and seriousness.

---

## FINAL MINDSET NOTE

Henrik is not a typical hiring manager. He is a founder (Readmill, Steady Health), an investor (Direkt Ventures, Neo), a former interaction designer, and someone who builds AI tools in his spare time for fun. He will respond to:

- **Genuine curiosity** about the problem space
- **Builder energy** -- you want to make things, not just talk about design theory
- **Directness** -- say what you think, don't hedge everything
- **Craft** -- he cares about design quality at a deep level
- **Self-awareness** -- know what you're great at and where you're still growing

This is a coffee chat, not an interrogation. Treat it like a conversation between two people who both care about building great products. If the energy is right, the logistics will follow.
