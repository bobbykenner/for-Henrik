# for-henrik

Mutiny builds personalized microsites to help companies close deals. This is one built to close mine.

A conversation canvas designed for a coffee chat with Henrik Berggren, Head of Product & Design at Mutiny. One static HTML page — no frameworks, no dependencies, just craft.

## What this is

A 1:1 microsite personalized for a specific person, used as a live screen-share companion during a 30-minute hiring manager conversation. Not a pitch deck. Not a portfolio. A notebook open on the table between two people talking about building things.
